Hello! I am a PhD student at Northwestern University in Computer Engineering. I am interested in hardware based machine learning. I am also collaborating with Fermilab on some HEP ASIC/FPGA projects.
My current research focus is on fault-related bit errors on ASICs.
  
My resume is here: [Resume](../assets/Resume_Alan_Guo.pdf)
